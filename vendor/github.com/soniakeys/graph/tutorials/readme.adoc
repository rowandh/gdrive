= Tutorials

Documents in this directory show usage patterns and explain concepts in more
detail than the primary documentation.  The primary documentation though
remains the Go doc format documentation within the Go source files.

They can be read in any order.  A suggested order might be

* link:dijkstra.adoc[Dijkstra's algorithm] (a quick start)
* link:adjacencylist.adoc[AdjacencyList types] (more explanation
  about this library's most fundamental data type.
* link:missingmethods.adoc[Missing methods] (looking for something?)
